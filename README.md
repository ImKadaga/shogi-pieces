## Piece Sets

### Kanji light 3D OTB
Designed mainly for 'over the board' games (tablet or phone laid flat).

### International

A modified version of [CouchTomato87](https://github.com/CouchTomato87/InternationalizedPieces/tree/master/Shogi)'s and [Hidetchi](https://github.com/Hidetchi)'s pieces. I made the hisha piece into a winged (flying) chariot that also looks like a rook. :) I also changed the bishop to a modified Hidetchi version, change/modified the lance, and made new king and jeweled pieces (the jeweled has a little jewel in the crown).

### Doubutsu

I recreated all of the original [Doubutsu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C5%8Dbutsu_sh%C5%8Dgi) pieces in Inkscape SVG format.

Credits: the original Doubutsu pieces were created by [Madoka Kitao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madoka_Kitao).

Also, you can play with this set on the [pychess-variants](https://www.pychess.org) website.

### Military

A new, self-made piece set. The moves are not changed of course, it's still "normal" shogi, only the pictures are different. When a piece got promoted it gets a red rank above its picture, except the tank (rook) which becomes a drone tank, and the aircraft (bishop) which becomes a drone.

(also: [screenshot with promoted pieces](https://i.imgur.com/CbX2MzN.png))
